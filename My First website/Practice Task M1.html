        Hello, I'm <i>Rashiduzzaman Khan</i>. Recently I went to <em>Ceder point Ohio</em> on a field trip form my school. Today I'll share my travel experience with you. Before that let me introduce myself. I said my name earlier. I completed my high school from <I><b>Hamtramck High School</b></I>. It's in <em>Michigan US</em>A. I'm going to pursue my <i>Bachelor's degree</i> from <i><b>Oakland University on Computer Science.</b></i>

            As we graduated, our school decided to go on a field trip somewhere out of state to celebrate our graduation. So, we went to <em>Ceder point</em> , it's in <em>the State Ohio</em> in the meddle of an island. Our entry fee was <b>$65</b><i>(we bought from school)</i>, but if you want to buy the ticket from the gate it's <b>$100</b>. We started for <I>Ceder Point</I> at 8 am via our school bus and arrived there at around 10 am. When I entered to the place it felt like my money went on a better place which can give me a good experience. Our guide teacher gave us <em>12 hours</em> to enjoy and explore <em>Ceder Point</em>, which was too much.

            So the first ride that we rode was the boat, it was quite normal for me. Then we went for the other rides. There were roller coasters(Up-side down, down-side up, vertical, horizontal, and skyscrapers), Power Tower, Water Park, and so on. For the entry in the Water Park there's an additional fee of <b>$65</b>.

        It was around <i>1 pm</i> I and two of my classmate became hungry. As all of us are muslim and for muslims there are <em><b>some restriction on food for our betterment and wellbeing</b></em>, we couldn't eat <i><b>Haram foods</b></i>. As most of the restaurant and food were Haram for muslims we went in an <i>Italian Restaurant</i> and ate only <i>cheese pizza</i> and Coke.

        If I want to say anything about those rides then I gotta say these are fucking crazy and mindblower. Those who have any heart problems, broken bones, panic attack should avoid riding. For them there are trains, cars of 1900s and music show. But the people who has issue with overthinking must ride all of the ride. We rode about 14 of them.

        For Muslims <em>Cedar Point</em> could be a place to struggle with food, prayer time management, keeping eyes down in order to avoid sins of eye to obey the rule of our creator Allah.

        We started for home at around 8 pm and arrived to our city by 10:30 pm. It was a nice trip I have ever enjoyed.
